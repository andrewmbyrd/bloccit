## Bloccit: a Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails.

Made with my entor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io)

This is a fully self-contained web application. No set up is required. The program can also be found in production at [heroku](https://salty-ravine-59807.herokuapp.com/)

Note that in production, the seed data, located in `db/seeds.rb` is not populated. 

Also note that only users that are authorized as admins can create new topics. So for practical purposes, use the development environment for any testing.
